Joshua Rabideau's Linux Server configuration project for Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree program.
Ip Address: 99.79.77.215
SSH Port 2200
Web Address:http://99.79.77.215.xip.io/
I installed Postgres and Apache as instructed as well as all packages necessary for previous project.
I changed the SSH port to 2200 and blocked all ports except 2200, 80 and 123. I added key pairs for grader user. I configured apache to redirect to my app.
My mentor gave me good advice on how to configure my app.
